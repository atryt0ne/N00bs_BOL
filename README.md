The computer has been one of the most important scientific inventions, and yet the computer is largely considered dumb, incapable of learning, atleast until the past few decades.

Technologies like deep learning are here to change that, and to teach computers what humans are capable of doing naturally, to write novels, give quizzes, play games and what not.

In this project, we shall explore deep learning, FNN, PCA, GD, CNN, RNN, encoder-decoder models.

# Week 1 - Setup
The goal for this week is to learn the basics of Python, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib and come up with guides to explain the same. 

# Week 2 - Some literature Review
After a discussion on Exploratory Data Analysis, and on how datasets are prepared for use in neural nets, literature reviews were conducted on the Stochastic Gradient Descent and Biases and Weights.
A simple implementation of a perceptron was made in Python which took in three inputs.

# Week 3 - Building a Neural Net
A more involved discussion on how a neural network works - Perceptrons and Hidden Layers, Loss Functions, Gradient Descents. The task for this week was to build a single layer neural network.
